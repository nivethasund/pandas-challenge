## PyCity Schools

With the help of Pandas and the PyCitySchools Starter File, I merged and analyzed the school data with student data. The summary and analysis can be found in the main script file. Using the data given, I've created data frames showing the following key metrics -
- District Summary
- School Summary
- Highest Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
- Lowest Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
- Math Scores by Grade
- Reading Scores by Grade
- Scores by School Spending
- Scores by School Size
- Scores by School Type

For this assignment, the starter code served as an amazing jumping point! I hardly had to refer to external resources and all of what was applied was learned through the course of the pandas module.
